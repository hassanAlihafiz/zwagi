          <h4>COVID Notice</h4>
          <p>
            Be advised that international shipments may experience delays due to
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, B-Epic is not responsible for
            packages you do not receive due to delivery issues caused by the
            pandemic in your area. As the consumer, it is your responsibility to
            be cognizant of mail service issues in your area and to track the
            shipment of your orders. Tracking is provided for all shipments;
            however, once the package leaves the United States that tracking may
            be behind due to delays in reporting in your area. If a package is
            missing in transit, it is the consumer's responsibility to file a
            claim with the mail carrier service. We thank you for your patience
            and understanding during these unprecedented times.
          </p>
          <h4>Delivery Time</h4>

          <p>
            At B-Epic we strive to ship orders immediately – normally within 1-2
            business days of processing an order, so you can expect to receive
            your order within 3-6 business days (depending on your location).
            Please note that we do not ship on weekends or holidays. Also,
            please allow more time if you are outside the continental USA.
          </p>
          <p>
            You (the customer) are responsible to track the delivery of your
            order once it has shipped from B-Epic. If you do not receive the
            package from the shipping carrier/postal carrier for any reason, you
            are solely responsible for contacting the shipping carrier/postal
            carrier to coordinate getting your package from them.
          </p>
          <p id="internationalshipping">
            You (the customer) will be charged a $20.00 USD fee for B-Epic to
            reship an order to you due to your negligence in receiving the
            package or due to an incorrect shipping address provided by you. In
            which case, you must contact B-Epic Member Support within 30 days of
            the placing the order otherwise no replacement order will be
            shipped.
          </p>
          <h4>International Shipping Terms and Restrictions</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Be advised that as of October 2020 orders going to the European
              Union (EU) and Russian speaking countries are now being fulfilled
              from our new shipper in the Netherlands. In this case, once the
              order ships, the track and trace number will be sent to the email
              address on file in the Member’s account profile; it will not be
              listed in the Order History in the Back Office. As the buyer, it
              is your responsibility to ensure the email address you provided
              with your account is valid and that you check for communications
              regarding your order(s).
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            By ordering from us you agree to these terms. You are advised to
            contact your country's customs office to thoroughly inquire about
            import regulations before placing your order, as we will not be
            liable for packages refused or held for delivery. As the buyer, you
            are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited
            import items, taxes, tariffs, fees, other duties, brokerage, and/or
            delivery fees applied to international shipments. Some countries
            have shipping restrictions on certain products, contents, or
            products containing certain ingredients. As the buyer, you are
            responsible for complying with all applicable international,
            national, and local laws regulating importation of products that you
            purchase. If your order is refused delivery by your country's
            customs office due to unauthorized product, contents, and/or
            ingredients, B-Epic is not responsible for any losses or costs
            incurred by you, the buyer. If the shipment is abandoned or
            discarded by customs, you will not receive a refund or credit of any
            kind. Also, some countries restrict imported supplements to a 90-day
            supply and must be for your own personal use; losses incurred due to
            exceeding your country's limitations will not be refunded.
            International shipping charges are non-refundable. Please be aware
            that getting a supplement approved for import often requires
            extensive, well documented official permits in advanced and no
            guaranteed to be approved by the other country's customs office.
            Thank you for your understanding.
          </p>
          <h4>MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</h4>

            unit product purchases. Sample size, product packs (e.g., Epic Pack
            and Epic Pack Plus), multi-unit purchases (e.g., Buy 2 Get 1 Free),
            Promos, and Limited Time Offers (LTOs) do not qualify.
          </p>
          <p id="returnsandrefunds">
            Be advised, there is a 25% restocking fee of the original purchase
            price for any product refund. Shipping and handling charges are
            non-refundable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note, some international orders may qualify for a time
            extension; contact Member Support for details.
          </p>
          <h4>RETURNS AND REFUND POLICY</h4>
          <p>
            B-Epic has a 30-day refund policy on product purchases. Refunds are
            only available on regular size, single unit product purchases.
            Sample size, product packs (e.g., Epic Pack and Epic Pack Plus),
            multiunit purchases (e.g., Buy 2 Get 1 Free), Promos, and Limited
            Time Offers (LTOs) do not qualify. Refunds are given based on the
            original purchase price. Be advised, there is a 25% restocking fee
            of the original purchase price for any product refund. Shipping and
            handling charges are non-refundable. The one-time sign-up fee for
            distributors is also non-refundable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a refund of a product purchase, you must submit a
            refund request to Member Support within 30 days of the original
            order date. Refunds are only given if this 30-day requirement is
            met. No exceptions can be made. Please note, some international
            orders may qualify for a time extension; contact Member Support for
            details.
          </p>
          <p>
            To request a refund, submit a Support Ticket via your online B-Epic
            Back Office. Be sure to include the order number. Once the request
            is processed, Member Support will provide you with a Return
            Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number, which needs to be clearly
            printed on the outside of your return package. To be eligible for a
            refund, all unused portions of the product must be returned, and the
            return package must be postmarked within the 30 days of the original
            order date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be advised that we do not accept – nor issue a refund for – returned
            orders without a proper RMA # (Return Merchandise Authorization
            number). So, before mailing us a return, contact Member Support so
            we can issue you an RMA # to print on the outside of your return
            package.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, be advised that we do not accept – nor issue a refund for –
            any package marked “return to sender” or “refused”. Nor do we accept
            C.O.D. returns. You are responsible for all costs related to
            shipping back the product and that it arrives to us without damage.
            Shipping charges are not reimbursed unless the return is due to an
            error on our part (i.e., you received an incorrect or defective
            item). Therefore, we recommend insuring your return package for your
            protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be advised that a refund will not be issued until after the returned
            product is received and processed by the B-Epic Fulfillment Center.
            Therefore, we recommend you get delivery tracking for your return
            package, so you have proof that it was shipped and delivered to
            B-Epic.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            After we receive the return, the refund will be issued to your
            E-Wallet account or credit card. Shipping, handling, and any other
            fees are non-refundable.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4>EXCHANGE POLICY</h4>
          <p>
            If for any reason, you want to exchange the product you ordered for
            a different one, you can do so as long as the following criteria are
            met. Be advised, there is a 25% restocking fee of the original
            purchase price for any product exchange. In order to qualify for an
            exchange, the product to be returned must be unopened, in new
            condition, and include all original packaging materials. In
            addition, you must submit the exchange request within 30 days of the
            original order date.
            <span id="ordersandbilling">Please note,</span> some international
            orders may qualify for a time extension; contact Member Support for
            details. You are responsible for all costs related to shipping back
            the product and that it arrives to us without damage. Therefore, we
            recommend insuring your return package for your protection. The
            return package must be postmarked within the 30 days of the original
            order date. Exchanges are only given if all of these requirements
            are met. No exceptions can be made. To request an exchange, submit a
            Support Ticket via your online Back Office. Be sure to include the
            order number.{" "}
          </p>
          <h4>ORDERS AND BILLING</h4>
          <p>
            Be advised that not all products, packs, and promotions are
            available in all markets. Different ones may be available in certain
            markets. Check the bepic.com ordering page for a list of those
            currently available in your market.
          </p>
          <p>
            At B-Epic there is no cost to become a customer. There is a small,
            one-time non-refundable sign-up fee to become an
            affiliate/independent distributor (Brand Partner). Both Customers
            and Brand Partners are classified as “Members” and have the option
            of purchasing products from B-Epic. Brand Partners are also given
            access to a business system and training materials should they
            choose to participate in the B-Epic business opportunity. There is
            no long-term commitment or timeframe in which a customer or Brand
            Partner must purchase products. Members may cancel their orders at
            any time and for any reason; follow the instructions below. Be
            advised that cancellations must be made at least 24 hours in advance
            of when you want them to go into effect. Orders often ship within 12
            hours of being placed on workdays, so check your order carefully
            before confirming; we cannot cancel an order that has been shipped.
            Moreover, commissions can still be earned by Brand Partners who do
            not personally purchase product as per the B-Epic Brand Partner
            Compensation Plan provided on the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            In consideration for the products you order from B-Epic, you agree
            to pay the sums listed at the time such sums are due and owing. All
            prices are listed in USD. If a member’s credit card is declined for
            the payment due, the transaction will not go through in our system.
            B-Epic Member Support will answer any of your billing questions or
            concerns within 24 hours. Please always contact them first with any
            issues you may have and be sure to reference the specific order
            number. Authorization for the Company to provide and bill for the
            services and products is obtained by way of your electronic
            signature, credit card authorization, or voice affirmation as
            sanctioned by the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and the
            Electronic Signatures in Global and National Transactions Act.
          </p>
          <h4>Terms of the Rebilling</h4>
          <p>
            B-Epic Members have the option to enable a monthly automatic
            re-order / auto-shipment with their account. You may choose at any
            time to disable that feature or modify your autoship profile and
            preferences in your online account / Back Office before the next
            shipment is processed. Please be advised that cancellations must be
            made at least 24 hours in advance of when you want them to go into
            effect and you may be charged a 10% restocking fee if cancellation
            is requested after the order has gone through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accounts will be charged at a set time during each month, and the
            product will be shipped at a set time thereafter. Tracking numbers
            are available in your online account Order History after the product
            is shipped. The scheduled dates for processing, account charges, and
            shipping or account changes are posted in the online Back Office and
            are subject to change by B-Epic from time-to-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide
            for your billing is valid and complete. It is your responsibly to
            ensure that your payment for your personal orders goes through.
            Payments will be verified prior to processing monthly autoship
            orders. If payment authorization is not obtained by the end of the
            month’s period, the order will be designated "unprocessed" and will
            not be included in Commission computation and processing. B-Epic
            will not be held responsible for Volume shortfalls due to
            unprocessed orders.
          </p>

          <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
          <p>
            You can voluntarily terminate your account at any time and for any
            reason in your online back office or by contacting Member Support.
            Be advised that in order for an account termination to include your
            next shipment, it must be made at least 24 hours in advance of the
            order being processed. However, we cannot cancel an order that has
            been shipped. The termination is effective immediately, although be
            advised that processing of the termination request may be delayed
            until the following month if there is current Volume in the account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be advised that if a Member is in breach of the Contract, he
            or she cannot voluntarily or unilaterally terminate their account
            until the longer of: (i) the last day of the renewal period of the
            Contract, or (ii) the last day of the period equal to the amount of
            time such Member had been in violation of the Contract prior to the
            Company’s discovery of the breach, but not to exceed one (1) year.
            In such a case, the Company may elect any and all available remedies
            for breach of the Contract pursuant to Section 8, and the Member
            shall not be entitled to receive any Commissions during such period,
            as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. A Member may
            not voluntarily terminate if their account is not in good standing,
            as may be evidenced by, but not limited to, any of the following
            conditions: (i) a temporary account; (ii) an account is on hold, in
            suspension, or in probation; (iii) the account is under
            investigation, but no formal discipline has taken place; or (iv)
            notice of intent to terminate has been sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon termination of the account, all of the Member’s rights in and
            to the Subscription Program and the Affiliate Business are revoked
            and terminated. A Member who voluntarily terminates may re-apply for
            a new account under a new Sponsor no earlier than three (3) months
            from the date the Company receives notice of the termination. During
            this three (3) month period, the voluntarily terminated Member is
            not permitted to participate in any Member Business or have a
            beneficial interest in any Subscription Program.
          </p>
          <h4>Fraud, Chargebacks, and Reversals</h4>
          <p>
            We may, in our discretion, require further authorization from
            purchasers, such as a telephone confirmation of an order and other
            information necessary for verification. We reserve the right to
            cancel, delay, refuse to ship, or recall from the shipper any order
            if fraud is suspected. If fraud is suspected, we will immediately
            close the account and confiscate any funds left in the account
            and/or funds transferred to another account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be advised that we handle all chargebacks and reversals as potential
            cases of fraudulent use of our product offer and/or theft of
            product. We will immediately close the account and confiscate any
            funds left in the account and/or funds transferred to another
            account. In cases where we have provided a product and we have
            verified that a customer has received a product and/or refused or
            returned product(s), whether or not they have used the product in
            any way, possible actions taken by the Company may include filing a
            complaint with the Internet Crimes Bureau and/or reporting the
            incident to the appropriate authorities in your local jurisdiction

          <h4>BRAND PARTNER CODE OF ETHICS</h4>
          <p>
            All B-Epic Brand Partners are held to our Code of Ethics, which
            include not making disparaging remarks about other brand partners or
            companies and refraining from any fraudulent activities, illegal
            product or income claims, providing misleading information on
            company forms, cross-recruiting, and any other actions deemed
            harmful to the Company. B-Epic affiliates/independent distributors
            are required to disclose that they are an “Independent Brand
            Partner” on all marketing materials. All marketing materials must be
            approved by B-Epic Corporate. Use of the "B-Epic" and “BEPIC”
            company name is not allowed in Brand Partner email addresses or
            third-party marketing websites. Any violations of the Code of Ethics
            may result in the suspension or termination.
          </p>
          <h4>Cross-Recruiting Policy</h4>
          <p>
            We maintain a ZERO tolerance policy towards cross-recruiting. If you
            are found doing anything that could be considered cross-recruiting,
            we may issue one warning requiring your signature agreeing that you
            will to instantly stop the behavior in question. If you violate this
            policy, you risk immediate and permanent termination of your B-Epic
            account and forfeiture of all contacts and commissions in that
            account. Moreover, you will not be eligible for a refund if you are
            terminated for violating this policy. We also reserve the right to
            take legal action against any Brand Partner found violating this
            policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cross-line recruiting is strictly prohibited. During the term of
            this Agreement and a period of 90 days following termination,
            cancellation, or expiration of the Agreement, Brand Partners may not
            directly or indirectly solicit an individual that has previously
            been sponsored or enrolled by another B-Epic Brand Partner. Brand
            Partners may not offer, entice, or attempt to influence other Brand
            Partner’s or any Customer’s decision to leave another Brand
            Partner’s organization (in which they are currently involved) and
            instead sign up with (sponsor) them. However, Members are permitted
            to change their Sponsor after their account has been closed for 90
            days. In other words, they must give up their account, commissions,
            etc. for 90 days, then they can open a new account with a different
            Sponsor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cross-company recruiting is also strictly prohibited. During the
            term of this Agreement and a period of 90 days following
            termination, cancellation, or expiration of the Agreement, Brand
            Partners may not recruit other B-Epic Brand Partners or Customers
            for any other network marketing business, other than those they
            personally sponsored into B-Epic. For this purpose, “recruit” is
            defined as actual or attempted solicitation, enrollment, as well as
            any effort to influence to such end, either directly or through a
            third party. This encompasses recruiting others directly or
            indirectly whether through written, spoken, or implied means from
            B-Epic to another MLM, referral-based, or affiliate company.
          </p>
          <h4>Cross-Sponsoring Policy</h4>

          <p>
            B-Epic Brand Partners are free to participate in other network
            marketing companies. However, they may not use or disclose any
            confidential information, trade secrets, or goodwill of B-Epic in
            connection with any other network marketing business, including the
            identity of other B-Epic Brand Partners.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cross-sponsoring is strictly prohibited. B-Epic Brand Partners may
            not enroll an individual or entity that already has a current Brand
            Partner Agreement with B-Epic or who has had an agreement within the
            preceding six (6) calendar months under a different Sponsor. The use
            of a spouse’s or relative’s name, trade names, DBAs, assumed names,
            corporations, partnerships, federal ID numbers (real or fictitious),
            or any other attempt to circumvent this policy is prohibited.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a Brand Partner is found to be enrolled or participating in two
            or more B-Epic businesses simultaneously, the first B-Epic business
            will be considered the valid business.
          </p>

          <p>
            B-Epic may take disciplinary action against the Brand Partner that
            changed organizations and/or those Brand Partners who encouraged or
            participated in the Cross-Sponsoring. The ultimate decision
            regarding the placement of the organization is at the sole
            discretion of B-Epic Corporate, and there will be no adjustments to
            commission payout regardless of the decision made. B-Epic Brand
            Partners waive all claims and causes of action against B-Epic
            Corporate arising from or relating to the disposition of the
            cross-sponsored Brand Partner’s downline organization.
          </p>
          <h4>Anti-Spam Policy</h4>
          <p>
            In order to protect our Members and ensure the long-term growth and
            success of B-Epic, we maintain a ZERO tolerance policy towards the
            sending of spam. Spam email is defined as Unsolicited Commercial
            Email (UCE). B-Epic neither condones nor tolerates the sending of
            unsolicited or spam email by its affiliates/independent
            distributors. You are solely responsible for email sent on your
            behalf. In the event that you send spam email to people without
            their permission, you risk immediate and permanent termination of
            your B-Epic account and forfeiture of all contacts and commissions
            in that account.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a B-Epic Brand Partner, you understand and acknowledge all the
            following:{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            It is illegal to forge B-Epic information and headers in emails and
            it is illegal to neglect to include a valid unsubscribe link in any
            emails sent out. Anyone found doing so will have their B-Epic
            account terminated.
          </p>
          <p>
            All B-Epic Brand Partners are required to download from their Back
            Office the list of email addresses that have generated a complaint
            and permanently remove them from their database. If we receive a
            complaint from the same email address as a previous complaint from
            an email that was sent more than a week after the original complaint
            was filed, B-Epic has the right to terminate your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            B-Epic does not allow traffic from traffic exchange websites or
            other low-quality traffic sources. Any affiliate/independent
            distributor who has what B-Epic considers by its discretion an
            abnormally low conversion rate from hits to their landing pages may
            have their websites deactivated and/or their B-Epic account
            terminated.
          </p>
          <p>
            B-Epic will immediately and permanently terminate your account and
            suspend all future commissions for violating these policies. You
            will not be eligible for a refund if you are terminated for
            violating these policies. We also reserve the right to take legal
            action against any Member found violating this policy.

            including, but not limited to, breach of contract, breach of
            warranty, negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation, and any
            and all other torts. You hereby release the Company from any and all
            obligations, liabilities, and claims in excess of the limitations
            stated herein. If applicable law does not permit such limitation,
            the maximum liability of the Company to you under any and all
            circumstances will be the amount you paid for the products ordered
            and paid for on the Site and/or from the Company. No action,
            regardless of form, arising out of your use of the Site, the
            products, and/or any other products and/or services offered on the
            Site and/or from the Company may be brought by you more than one (1)
            year following the event which gave rise to the cause of action. The
            negation of damages set forth above is a fundamental element of the
            basis of the bargain between you and the Company. Access to the Site
            and/or the services and products would not be provided to you
            without such limitations. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain
            limitations on liability and in such jurisdictions company liability
            shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
