            <h5>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h5>

            <p>
              Zwagil Foundation collects information from our web site in
              several ways. During registration, Zwagil Foundation asks for
              information such as your name, phone number, and email address.
              Once you have submitted this information and chosen a valid
              password, you will be able to take full advantage of everything
              Zwagil Foundation has to offer. You may also be asked for personal
              information when you report a problem with our site, or services;
              or, if you otherwise contact Zwagil Foundation. Zwagil Foundation
              also collects information using cookies, which are small pieces of
              information that are stored by your browser on your computer's
              hard drive. This information allows us to automatically link our
              donors to their personalized accounts. Most web browsers
              automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser's
              guidelines should you wish to prevent cookies. Zwagil Foundation
              is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We
              will not sell, share, rent or otherwise distribute this
              information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in
              this statement.

            <h5>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE</h5>

            <p>
              When you are on the Zwagil Foundation site and are asked for
              personal information, you are sharing that information with only
              Zwagil Foundation, its agents and representatives. Zwagil
              Foundation will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
              information except when we have your express permission or under
              special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that
              the law requires it. Zwagil Foundation may also disclose account
              information in special cases when we have reason to believe that
              disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or
              bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or
              interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Zwagil
              Foundationâ€™s rights or property, other Zwagil Foundation donors,
              or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Zwagil
              Foundation will comply with the requests of all recognized legal
              entities to aid in the stopping of spam, distribution of illicit
              sexual content to minors, or any other illegal activity brought to
              our attention through such channels.
