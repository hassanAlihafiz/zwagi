            <h3>Multiple Ways To Earn</h3>
            <p>Our compensation plan is one of the best in the industry because it is designed to maximize the earning potential of our Brand Partners. It provides multiple ways for you to earn money, including an industry-leading bonus program.</p>  
            <p>First, it costs nothing to get started. Then with one product order, you’re in business. As a promoter you get paid 50% of every new customer order you secure. Many of our Brand Partners build their business just by promoting the products to customers.</p>  
            <p>If you want to expand your business, when you bring in a new Brand Partner, you’re paid 50% of their first order and qualify for a percentage of their organization’s volume as well. And as your business continues grow, so do your opportunities to earn.</p>
