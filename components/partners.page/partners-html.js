                <h3>Heifer International</h3>
                <p>
                Every girl deserves an education initiative.  132 million girls worldwide aren’t able to attend school or are denied an education. Often, they must work in the fields or in the home to help support the family.  But when a family is given the resources, tools and training to build a sustainable income, the girl is able to leave the field and attend school, breaking the cycle of poverty and changing her future forever.  Heifer’s model is all about empowering families to raise themselves out of hunger and poverty through building sustainable farms and a steady stream of income.

                  services to online platforms to proactively detect and delete
                  abuse content. Thorn is considered the world’s leader in
                  developing and depolying technology to fight human trafficking
