                    <p >
                      Food insecurity affects hundreds of millions of people
                      worldwide. Even in America 1 in 7 people struggle to put
                      food on their table, with families with children being the
                      most likely to experience hunger. The Zwagil Foundation is
                      dedicated to making sure that children and families never
                      go hungry.
